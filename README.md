### About
This plugin is similar to a lower version of Clockmenu (1.12.2 below) because the original author may have abandoned the game and 
Chinese website did not find a new plugin, so they wrote this plugin on a whim, as if the title is to specify item binding instructions. 
This allows some players who are new to the game and are not familiar with the instructions to directly open the homepage (menu) with the
corresponding item in a fully GUI style operation (Chestcommand, etc.), making it easier for beginners to get started, and so on.
